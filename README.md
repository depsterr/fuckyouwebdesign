# fuckyouwebdesign
A website made as a parody of w3schools and such meant to teach you about minimalist web design

The website is live at [fuckyouwebdesign.com](http://fuckyouwebdesign)

## Site structure

All main pages should be in the root directory, all other tutorial pages should have their own folder which should then be linked in toc.html
